Here is a more detailed explanation of the calculator code you provided:

1. **Declaration of Variables and Characters:**
   - In this section, variables for storing numbers and operators used in the calculator are defined.
   - Operators such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, decimal point, equals, clear, delete, and change sign are defined.

2. **Creating and Setting up Panels and Frames:**
   - In this part, panels and frames are set up to display inputs and buttons conveniently.
   - Various specifications such as size, color, coordinates, and font for each component are configured.

3. **Adding Buttons and Operators:**
   - Buttons for numbers from 0 to 9, operators for addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, decimal point, equals, clear, delete, and change sign are added.
   - Each button is connected to the corresponding action to be performed (like adding a number or operator).

4. **Main Calculator Functionality:**
   - When a user selects an operator or a number, the behavior is determined by a device to respond appropriately.
   - For operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, the necessary number and operator are selected, and the calculation is carried out correctly.

5. **Button Events:**
   - Using the ActionListener interface, the behavior of buttons is defined, and upon clicking each button, the respective action is executed.
